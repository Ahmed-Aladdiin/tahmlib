# tahmlib
tahmlib is a simple C++ library for making video games.

tahmlib is inspired by Love2D, and is a bare-bones way of programming games: no fancy interface, no level editor. Just pick your favorite code editor and program away

Currently tested for Windows 10.

## How to run
tahmlib was made with Visual Studio 2022. It uses the "Desktop Development with C++" module. Install those and run Visual Studio. Afterwards, click on "Clone a Repository". <br/>
